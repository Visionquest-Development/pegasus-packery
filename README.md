**What is the difference between Masonry, Isotope, and Packery?**


Masonry, Isotope, and Packery are all similar in that they are layout libraries. Many of their options and methods are the same.

Masonry does cascading grid "masonry" layouts. Packery does bin-packing layouts, which allow it to be used for draggable interactions.

Isotope does sorting and filtering. Isotope uses masonry layouts, as well as other layouts.
